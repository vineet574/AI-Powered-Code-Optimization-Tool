# AI-Powered-Code-Optimization-Tool
An AI-powered tool that analyzes Python code and suggests optimizations using machine learning. It evaluates code features like lines, variables, and loops to predict whether the code is efficient or needs improvement.
AI-Powered Code Optimization Tool
Overview
The AI-Powered Code Optimization Tool is designed to analyze Python code and provide suggestions on whether the code is efficient or needs optimization. It leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze features such as the number of lines, variables, and loops in the code, and then makes predictions based on a trained model.

Features
Code Analysis: Uses Pythonâ€™s Abstract Syntax Tree (ast) to break down and analyze the code.
Machine Learning Prediction: Utilizes a decision tree classifier to predict whether the code is optimized or requires improvements.
Customizable: You can expand the dataset and add more features like function calls, recursion, etc., to make the predictions more accurate.
Installation
To get started with the project, you need to have Python 3.6+ installed. Follow these steps to set up and run the tool:

1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AI_Code_Optimizer.git
cd AI_Code_Optimizer
2. Create a virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env
3. Activate the virtual environment:
Windows:
bash
Copy code
env\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
source env/bin/activate
4. Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Run the code:
bash
Copy code
python optimizer.py
Usage
The tool takes a snippet of Python code as input and analyzes it to determine whether it is efficient or requires optimization. The tool is designed to be expanded, allowing users to add more training data and code features for more accurate results.

Example
python
Copy code
for i in range(10):
    x = i * 2
The tool will analyze this code and provide feedback:

csharp
Copy code
Code is efficient
Project Structure
optimizer.py: The main Python file that contains the logic for code analysis and machine learning prediction.
README.md: Documentation for the project.
requirements.txt: List of dependencies needed for the project.
Future Enhancements
Expand the dataset with more diverse code samples.
Include additional features like function calls, recursion, and nested loops for better analysis.
Implement refactoring suggestions based on the analysis.
